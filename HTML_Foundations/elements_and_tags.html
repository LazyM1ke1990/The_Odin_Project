    <h1>Elements and Tags</h1>
    <p> 
        Almost all elements on a HTML page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags.<br>
        Opening tags tell the browser that it is at the start of a HTML element. They are defined by using angled brackets '<>'<br>
        An example would be the paragraph element <em>THIS</em> paragraph is enclosed in. It starts with an opening tag '< p >'<br>
        followed by the actual paragraph, then ending with a closing tag '< /p >' like the example below.<br>
        <br>
        < p >Enter Paragraph here< /p ><br>
        <br>
        The Closing tag is the opposite to the opening tag. The closing tag tells the browser that it has reached the end of that<br>
        element. The second difference is that it has a forward slash '/' immediately after the first angled bracket.<br>
        This is used to distinguish between opening and closing tags.<br>     
    </p>

    <p>
        Elements are like containers for content. The opening and closing tags tell the browser what content the element holds.
        Using this information the browser can determine how to interpret and format the content held in the container tags.
    </p>

    <p>
        HTML has a vast list of predifined tags for all kinds of different elements. It is important to use the correct tags<br>
        for content as it has a big impact on accessability for the users to the site.<br>
        Using the correct elements for content is called semantic HTML.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some HTML tags do not have closing tags. These tags just have the opening tag like '< br >' or '< img >'<br>
        These are known as 'VOID' elements. This is because they are void of content, being void of content<br>
        means your unable to 'Wrapped' tags around anything like other tags do.
