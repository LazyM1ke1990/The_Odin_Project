    <h1>Working with Text</h1>
    <h2>Paragraphs:</h2>
    <p>
        You can type text directly into the body of a html document but there would be no<br>
        formatting so you couldnt for example distinguish a paragraph from blocks of text.
        If paragraphs are made in the HTML code the browser would automatically condense<br>
        the spaces between the paragraphs into one block removing the spaces.
    </p>

    <p>
        To setup a paragraph element you would use the '< p >' opening and closing tags.<br>
        Using these before and after a paragraph will help the browser know its a paragraph<br>
        your typing and format the text with spaces between each paragraph like it is supposed to.<br>
        This paragraph that is being read now has Paragraph tags around it, aswell as the above.
    </p>
    <h2>Headings:</h2>
    <p>
        There are six different levels of headings all being size and boldness. These headings<br>
        range from '< h1 > to < h6 >' h1 being the largest and most important. Its good practice<br>
        to only use one h1 element on each page.<br>
        Using the correct heading size is important to the pages structure as it provides a<br>
        hierarchy to the content.
    </p>
    <h2>Nesting and Indentation:</h2>
    <p>
        Indentation is used in HTML code when we nest elements inside of other elements.<br>
        This produces a 'Parent' and 'Child' relationship between them. The element that is nested<br>
        is known as the child element and the element it is nested inside of is known as the<br>
        parent.<br>
        Example would be the Paragraph element is nested inside of a body element.<br>
        The body element being the parent and the paragraph element being the child.<br>
        Parent elements can have multiple children elements at the same nesting level. for<br>
        example i could have two paragraph elements under the one body element.<br>
        To make these clear we use indentation on the child elements.
    </p>
    <h2>HTML Comments:</h2>
    <p>
        HTML comments are used to remind or annotate HTML code to help other users or<br>
        yourself in the future. These comments are not visible to the browser and are made by<br>
        enclosing comments in side '< !--' and ' -->' tags.<br>
        Example: < !-- This is a comment -- ><br>
        <strong>Shortcut:</strong> Ctrl + / comment selected line out automatically.
